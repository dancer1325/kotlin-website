[//]: # (title: CocoaPods overview and setup)

* Kotlin/Native
  * has an integration -- with the -- [CocoaPods dependency manager](https://cocoapods.org/)

* CocoaPods dependency manager
  * uses
    * add dependencies | Pod libraries
    * multiplatform project's native targets -- as a -- CocoaPods dependency

* if you manage Pod dependencies | (directly) IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio -> you can 
  * enjoy ALL the additional features (code highlighting and completion)
  * build the WHOLE Kotlin project -- via -- Gradle / WITHOUT using Xcode
    * ONLY necessity to use Xcode
      * change Swift/Objective-C code
      * run your application | Apple simulator or device
      * recommendations
        * [update your Podfile](#update-podfile-for-xcode) 

* dependencies can be added -- based on -- your project and purposes
  * between 
    * [Kotlin project -- & a -- Pod library](native-cocoapods-libraries.md)
    * [Kotlin Gradle project and an Xcode project](native-cocoapods-xcode.md)

## Set up an environment to work with CocoaPods

* Install the [CocoaPods dependency manager](https://cocoapods.org/)
  * ways
    * -- via --
      * RVM
        1. TODO: Install [Ruby version manager](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) in case you don't have it yet.
        2. Install Ruby. You can choose a specific version:

            ```bash
            rvm install ruby 3.0.0
            ```

        3. Install CocoaPods:

            ```bash
            sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin cocoapods
            ```
      * Rbenv
        1. Install [rbenv from GitHub](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation) in case you don't have it yet.
        2. Install Ruby. You can choose a specific version:

            ```bash
            rbenv install 3.0.0
            ```

        3. Set the Ruby version as local for a particular directory or global for the whole machine:

            ```bash
            rbenv global 3.0.0
            ```
                
        4. Install CocoaPods:

            ```bash
            sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin cocoapods
            ```
      * Default Ruby
        * NOT valid | Apple M chips
        * 
          ```bash
          sudo gem install cocoapods
          ```
      * Homebrew
        * POSSIBLE compatibility issues
          * Reason: 🧠 installs the [Xcodeproj](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj) gem / can NOT be updated -- via -- Homebrew & if the installed Xcodeproj does NOT support the newest Xcode version yet -> failure 🧠
        1.
            ```bash
            brew install cocoapods
            ```

## Add and configure Kotlin CocoaPods Gradle plugin

If your environment is set up correctly, you can [create a new Kotlin Multiplatform project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/multiplatform-create-first-app.html)
and choose **CocoaPods Dependency Manager** as the iOS framework distribution option. The plugin will automatically generate the project for you.

If you want to configure your project manually:

1. In `build.gradle(.kts)` of your project, apply the CocoaPods plugin as well as the Kotlin Multiplatform plugin:
    
    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        kotlin("multiplatform") version "%kotlinVersion%"
        kotlin("native.cocoapods") version "%kotlinVersion%"
    }
    ```

2. Configure `version`, `summary`, `homepage`, and `baseName` of the Podspec file in the `cocoapods` block:
    
    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        kotlin("multiplatform") version "%kotlinVersion%"
        kotlin("native.cocoapods") version "%kotlinVersion%"
    }
 
    kotlin {
        cocoapods {
            // Required properties
            // Specify the required Pod version here. Otherwise, the Gradle project version is used.
            version = "1.0"
            summary = "Some description for a Kotlin/Native module"
            homepage = "Link to a Kotlin/Native module homepage"
   
            // Optional properties
            // Configure the Pod name here instead of changing the Gradle project name
            name = "MyCocoaPod"

            framework {
                // Required properties              
                // Framework name configuration. Use this property instead of deprecated 'frameworkName'
                baseName = "MyFramework"
                
                // Optional properties
                // Specify the framework linking type. It's dynamic by default. 
                isStatic = false
                // Dependency export
                export(project(":anotherKMMModule"))
                transitiveExport = false // This is default.
                // Bitcode embedding
                embedBitcode(BITCODE)
            }

            // Maps custom Xcode configuration to NativeBuildType
            xcodeConfigurationToNativeBuildType["CUSTOM_DEBUG"] = NativeBuildType.DEBUG
            xcodeConfigurationToNativeBuildType["CUSTOM_RELEASE"] = NativeBuildType.RELEASE
        }
    }
    ```

3. Run **Reload All Gradle Projects** in IntelliJ IDEA (or **Sync Project with Gradle Files** in Android Studio)
   to re-import the project.
4. Generate the [Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) to avoid compatibility
   issues during an Xcode build.

When applied, the CocoaPods plugin does the following:

* Adds both `debug` and `release` frameworks as output binaries for all macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS targets.
* Creates a `podspec` task which generates a [Podspec](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html)
file for the project.

The `Podspec` file includes a path to an output framework and script phases that automate building this framework during 
the build process of an Xcode project.

## Update Podfile for Xcode

If you want to import your Kotlin project in an Xcode project, you need to make some changes to your Podfile:

* If your project has any Git, HTTP, or custom Podspec repository dependencies, you should also specify the path to
the Podspec in the Podfile.

    For example, if you add a dependency on `podspecWithFilesExample`, declare the path to the Podspec in the Podfile:

    ```ruby
    target 'ios-app' do
        # ... other dependencies ...
        pod 'podspecWithFilesExample', :path => 'cocoapods/externalSources/url/podspecWithFilesExample'
    end
    ```

    The `:path` should contain the filepath to the Pod.

* When you add a library from the custom Podspec repository, you should also specify the [location](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#source)
of specs at the beginning of your Podfile:

    ```ruby
    source 'https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-cocoapods-spec.git'

    target 'kotlin-cocoapods-xcproj' do
        # ... other dependencies ...
        pod 'example'
    end
    ```

> After making changes in the Podfile, run **Reload All Gradle Projects** in IntelliJ IDEA
> (or **Sync Project with Gradle Files** in Android Studio) to re-import the project.
>
{type="note"}

If you don't make these changes to the Podfile, the `podInstall` task will fail, and the CocoaPods plugin will show
an error message in the log.

## Possible issues and solutions

### CocoaPods installation {initial-collapse-state="collapsed"}

#### Ruby installation

CocoaPods is built with Ruby, and you can install it with the default Ruby that should be available on macOS.
Ruby 1.9 or later has a built-in RubyGems package management framework that helps you install the [CocoaPods dependency manager](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation).

If you're experiencing problems installing CocoaPods and getting it to work, follow [this guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
to install Ruby or refer to the [RubyGems website](https://rubygems.org/pages/download/) to install the framework.

#### Version compatibility

We recommend using the latest Kotlin version. If your current version is earlier than 1.7.0, you'll need to additionally
install the [`cocoapods-generate`](https://github.com/square/cocoapods-generate#installation") plugin.

However, `cocoapods-generate` is not compatible with Ruby 3.0.0 or later. In this case, downgrade Ruby or upgrade Kotlin
to 1.7.0 or later.

### Build errors when using Xcode {initial-collapse-state="collapsed"}

Some variations of the CocoaPods installation can lead to build errors in Xcode.
Generally, the Kotlin Gradle plugin discovers the `pod` executable in `PATH`, but this may be inconsistent depending on
your environment.

To set the CocoaPods installation path explicitly, you can add it to the `local.properties` file of your project
manually or using a shell command:

* If using a code editor, add the following line to the `local.properties` file:

    ```text
    kotlin.apple.cocoapods.bin=/Users/Jane.Doe/.rbenv/shims/pod
    ```

* If using a terminal, run the following command:

    ```shell
    echo -e "kotlin.apple.cocoapods.bin=$(which pod)" >> local.properties
    ```

### Module not found {initial-collapse-state="collapsed"}

You may encounter a `module 'SomeSDK' not found` error that is connected with the [C-interop](native-c-interop.md) issue.
Try these workarounds to avoid this error:

#### Specify the framework name 

1. Look through the downloaded Pod directory `[shared_module_name]/build/cocoapods/synthetic/IOS/Pods/...`
   for the `module.modulemap` file.
2. Check the framework name inside the module, for example `AppsFlyerLib {}`. If the framework name doesn't match the Pod
name, specify it explicitly:

    ```kotlin
    pod("FirebaseAuth") {
        moduleName = "AppsFlyerLib"
    }
    ```
#### Specify headers

If the Pod doesn't contain a `.modulemap` file, like the `pod("NearbyMessages")`, specify the main header explicitly:

```kotlin
pod("NearbyMessages") {
    version = "1.1.1"
    headers = "GNSMessages.h"
}
```

Check the [CocoaPods documentation](https://guides.cocoapods.org/) for more information. If nothing works, and you still
encounter this error, report an issue in [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newissue?project=kt).

### Rsync error {initial-collapse-state="collapsed"}

You might encounter the `rsync error: some files could not be transferred` error. It's a [known issue](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/11946)
that occurs if the application target in Xcode has sandboxing of the user scripts enabled.

To solve this issue:

1. Disable sandboxing of user scripts in the application target:

   ![Disable sandboxing CocoaPods](disable-sandboxing-cocoapods.png){width=700}

2. Stop the Gradle daemon process that might have been sandboxed:

    ```shell
    ./gradlew --stop
    ```
